# Edumate

Edumate makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect – inside and outside of schools.
Edumate saves time and paper and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments,
communicate and stay organised.

There are many benefits to using Edumate:

- Easy to set up – Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It
  takes just minutes to set up.
- Saves time – The simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review and mark
  assignments quickly, all in one place.
- Improves organization – Students can see all of their assignments, and all class materials (e.g.,
  documents, photos, and videos).
- Enhances communication – Edumate allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions
  instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the
  stream.

## Architecture

The Google Classroom-like Android app is built with a robust architecture to ensure maintainability,
scalability, and clean code. We've used the MVVM pattern with Clean Architecture:

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: This architecture pattern separates the user interface from the
  business logic and data, making the app easy to test and maintain.

- **Clean Architecture**: It ensures a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to make
  changes in the future without disrupting the entire app.
